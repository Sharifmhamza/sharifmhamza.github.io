## About Me

I am currently a Research Associate at the [Mohammed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](http://www.mbzuai.ac.ae), where I also completed my master's degree in Computer Vision. During my master's studies, I was affiliated with the [Xu Lab](https://xulabs.github.io/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I worked under the primary supervision of (Dr. Min Xu)[https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/] and the secondary guidance of (Dr. Mohammad Yaqub)[https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/mohammad-yaqub/].

I received my undergraduate degree from the [University of Engineering and Technology (UET) Lahore, Pakistan](https://www.uet.edu.pk/home/). During this period, I gained valuable research experience through internships at the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI GmbH)](https://www.dfki.de/web) and the [Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Germany](https://rptu.de/en/).

After completing my undergraduate studies, I served as a Research Associate at [Salim Habib University](https://www.shu.edu.pk/), working under the supervision of [Dr. Rizwan Khan](https://sites.google.com/site/drkhanrizwan17/). Alongside my academic career, I also gained practical industry experience as a machine learning engineer at leading firms such as [Ephlux](https://www.ephlux.com/) and [Afiniti](https://www.afiniti.com/), where I honed my expertise in machine learning applications.
