## About Me

I am currently a Research Associate at the [Mohammed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](http://www.mbzuai.ac.ae), where I also completed my master's degree in Computer Vision. During my master's studies, I was affiliated with the [Xu Lab](https://xulabs.github.io/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I worked under the primary supervision of [Dr. Min Xu](https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/) and the secondary guidance of [Dr. Mohammad Yaqub](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/mohammad-yaqub/).

I received my undergraduate degree from the [University of Engineering and Technology (UET) Lahore, Pakistan](https://www.uet.edu.pk/home/). During this period, I gained valuable research experience through internships at the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI GmbH)](https://www.dfki.de/web) and the [Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Germany](https://rptu.de/en/).

After completing my undergraduate studies, I served as a Research Associate at [Salim Habib University](https://www.shu.edu.pk/), working under the supervision of [Dr. Rizwan Khan](https://sites.google.com/site/drkhanrizwan17/). Alongside my academic career, I also gained practical industry experience as a machine learning engineer at leading firms such as [Ephlux](https://www.ephlux.com/) and [Afiniti](https://www.afiniti.com/), where I honed my expertise in machine learning applications.

## Research Interests

My research centers on **Multi-modal Generative and Discriminative Learning** with a specific focus on medical imaging. Key areas of exploration include **1.** Multimodal Vision-Language Models for Medical Image and Text Analysis, **2.** Integrating generative and discriminative techniques to enhance segmentation performance, **3.** World-centric evaluations of multi-modal segmentation models, and **4.** Self-supervised learning methods to enhance segmentation performance while minimizing labeled data requirements.
